        <i>My husband and I enjoy lasagna, seafood and Mexican fare. One evening, I 
        combined all three into this deliciously different entree. It certainly is a 
        tempting, memorable change of pace from traditional Italian-style lasagnas.

    <ul>
        <li>1 jar (20 ounces) picante sauce</li>
        <li>1-1/2 pounds uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>4 to 6 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup butter, cubed</li>
        <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 can (14-1/2 ounces) chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>5 corn tortillas (6 inches), warmed</li>
        <li>1 package (16 ounces) imitation crabmeat, flaked</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>Sour cream and minced fresh cilantro, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Place picante sauce in a blender; cover and process until smooth. 
            Set aside. In a large skillet cook shrimp and cayenne in oil for about 
            3 minutes or until shrimp turn pink. Add garlic; cook 1 minute longer. 
            Remove and set aside. </li>
        <li>In the same skillet, melt butter. Stir in flour until smooth. Gradually add 
            broth. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Reduce 
            heat. Stir in cream and picante sauce; heat through. </li>
        <li>Spread 1/2 cup of sauce in a greased 13x9-in. baking dish. Layer with six tortillas, 
            half of the shrimp, crab and sauce and 1-1/4 cups cheese. Repeat layers. Tear or cut remaining 
            tortillas; arrange over cheese. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. </li>
        <li>Bake, uncovered, at 375° for 30-35 minutes or until bubbly. Let stand 15 minutes before cutting. 
            Garnish with sour cream and minced cilantro if desired.</li>
    </ol>
